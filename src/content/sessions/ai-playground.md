The session introduced students to core AI concepts through a series of interactive demos and hands-on activities. Using tools like Quick, Draw!, Semantris, Blob Opera, and Instrument Playground, students witnessed how AI can interpret images, text, and sounds â€” and even generate creative outputs.

The session featured rotating stations, where small groups explored different AI experiments. 

After the rotations, members came together to discuss their favorite experiments, reflect on what they learned, and connect the demos to real-world AI applications like Google Translate, voice assistants, and face filters.

The session encouraged curiosity and critical thinking, while demystifying AI as something tangible, creative, and fun.
