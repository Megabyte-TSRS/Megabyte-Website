At Vasant Valley School's Competetive Coding competition, Byte Battles, Ayaan Bansal (grade 9) secured an impressive 3rd place. The event had two stages -- a preliminary and a finals round. Participants had to solve a series of programming problems under a time limit, using any programming language they want. The winners were decided based on the accuracy of their code as well as the time they took to write it.
