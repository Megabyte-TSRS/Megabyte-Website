Megabyte co-organised this inter-house event, which saw almost 200 participants from across houses and grades in a closely-fought contest. 

The event consisted of an online phase, which lasted two days, and an offline phase, which took place over two hours on the 7th of May. Based on a weighted sum of offline and online phase points, and the time taken to complete questions in the offline phase of the event, the final standings were:

1. Srishti House
2. Himgiri House
3. Vasundhara House
4. Sagar House

The winners of the 'Most Valuable Player' award were:

1. Aarush Aggarwal [Vasundhara House]
2. Dhruv Kapur [Srishti House]
3. Arjun Narasimhan [Himgiri House]

Vedant Rathi [Sagar House] won an honourable mention.

The organising team consisted of: 

1. Rohan Kapur (Head of ICT)
2. Rohan Kathuria (Head of Activities)
3. Aarav Wadhwani (Head of Megabyte)
4. Advay Gupta
5. Arjun Sharma
