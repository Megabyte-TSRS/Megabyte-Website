description: "In this interactive session, members of the Megabyte Society got an inside look at how Crypthunt-style puzzles are created. Crypthunt, a digital treasure hunt known for its cryptic clues and tech-based challenges, has become one of the most exciting events of the year, and this time, students werenâ€™t just solving it, they were designing it."

The session began with a walkthrough of the different types of questions typically seen in Crypthunt including ciphers, hidden codes, binary conversions, source code clues, and visual tricks. Students learned how simple tools and a bit of creativity can be used to build engaging and mind-bending levels.

After this introduction, participants were challenged to create their own original Crypthunt-style question. Working individually or in small teams, they developed clues, hid messages, and tested their ideas. Each group then presented their puzzle to the rest of the students, turning the session into a mini Crypthunt of its own.

The session combined logic, coding, and creativity giving students a deeper appreciation for the thought process behind each level, while also preparing them for the upcoming full-scale Crypthunt event.
