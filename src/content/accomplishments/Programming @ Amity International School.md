At Amity International School's Competetive Coding competition, Programming, our team secured an impressive 2nd place. The event had two stages -- a preliminary and a finals round. Participants had to solve a series of programming problems under a time limit, using any programming language they want. The winners were decided based on the accuracy of their code as well as the time they took to write it.

The team consisted of:

1. Abhyudaya Gupta (grade 10)
2. Devyansh Garg (grade 10)
