We started off the year by diving into the magic of Gen AI through three interactive segments displaying innovative and fun tools following a brief introduction: 
1. Podcast creation with Notebook LM - We took suggestions from the students for 2 podcast ideas, one being Italian brainrot and the other being The Shri Ram School. Towards the end of the session we played these podcasts and saw the magic unfold. 
2. Expression Recognition Model - Using Google's Teachable Machine, students created their own ai models by training it on expressions and movements made by them to detect moods and actions. 
3. Fun AI tools - Lastly we had a short demo of the Meta FAIR's Seamless language AI where volunteers speak into the system and hear themselves translated into a new language with their own voice style preserved.
