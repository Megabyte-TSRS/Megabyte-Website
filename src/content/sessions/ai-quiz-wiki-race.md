The session began with an AI Quiz, a custom Kahoot created to introduce students to essential AI topics in a fun and engaging way. The quiz featured questions on:

1. The differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning

2. Concepts like overfitting, natural language processing (NLP), neural networks, and other machine learning models

3. Fun facts about AI in pop culture, Turing Test, and everyday AI applications

With each question, members not only raced to get the highest score but also learned foundational AI concepts in a competitive setting.

After the quiz, members took part in a Wikipedia Race - a rapid-fire challenge where participants had to click through internal Wikipedia links to navigate from one tech-related term to another. The game tested their speed, logic, and understanding of how interconnected the tech world truly is.

Together, the quiz and wiki-race made this session a perfect mix of learning and fun, leaving members excited for more tech challenges in future sessions.
